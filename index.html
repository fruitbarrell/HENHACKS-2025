    <p>Our Mission: Healthcare can be a very unapproachable field and many people don't know where to begin
        when seeking it. It would be terrible for someone to not seek out healthcare because of how daunting it may be
        so we sought out to design a website to make this process as easy as possible. With the local physician finder and 
        automated assistant we seek to give our users the knowledge and comfort that their needs will be met so they can take action
        on their health.
    </p>
    <p>Automated Assistant: With our automated assistant you can simply tell them any question you need about 
        your healthcare needs. You can tell it symptoms and it can give you potential remedies or what the underlying problem is.
        Remember for anything beyond basic remedies, consult your doctor! Our next tool can help with that!
    </p>
    <p>Physician Finder: Our physician finder can locate local doctors in your area as well as specialists that can
        cater to your specific needs. This will show you their location as well as contact info, care is just a few clicks away!
